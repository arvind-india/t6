# Easy-IOT
Easy IOT is an "oriented-Data" platform to connect physical Objects with timeseries DB.

## Structure & Context
### Physical World
Physical World are composed by your sensors and actuators.
Physical Objects require a virtual _Object_ in Easy-IOT and then, they could add _Data_ to _Flows_. 

### General

| Verb | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GET | http://127.0.0.1:3000/v2.0.1/v2.0.1/status | _n/a_ | Get the status of the API |

### Objects
_Objects_ are virtual items dedicated to push data to flows.
_Objects_ are defined for each _Users_.

| Verb | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GET | http://127.0.0.1:3000/v2.0.1/objects/ | _Bearer_ | Get the list of _Objects_ from the current _User_. |

### Flows
_Flows_ are datastore to save time/value.
Each _Object_ can POST data to multiple _Flows_.
_Flows_ are defined for each _Users_ and are having permissions.

### Security
* Make a HTTP POST request to endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:3000/v2.0.1/users/me/token) with your own private API_KEY and API_SECRET, which validates the user's API key pair:
Body content: ```{"key": "09grc1a3-c0be-1239-a848-9bd8890a11k6", "secret": "a128y052-f449-658a-a278-95f995323f4c"}```
* API generates a temporary access token that will expire in 1 hour
* Then you can use any _Bearer_ endpoint by adding "Authorization: Bearer _token_". 

Permissions granted - TODO:
* On _Flows_ and _Data_:
* 'r': stands for Readonly access
* 'rw': stands for Read+Write access

Some Endpoints require an _Admin_ permission which is set on the user.

### Mqtt rules to handle Actions
#### Rules
"Decision-Rule" engine is not yet pushed to github. But a working stable implementation is working at home since several months.
To sum up, events are pushed as json payloads to mqtt topics. Then the engine is watching for these payloads and handle them according to specific rules.

####Â Actions
_Actions_ are triggered when something is happening on the Easy-IOT platform.
Actions can be: email, SMS, API calls (e.g. twitter), etc ... 


## Easy-IOT Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mathcoll/Easy-IOT.git ./Easy-IOT & cd Easy-IOT
npm install
```

You can add the server running as a service, tested with Ubuntu and Debian:
* First: install the server in services:
```
sudo ln -s /var/www/EasyIOT/etc/init.d/EasyIOT /etc/init.d/Easy-IOT
```

* Then set the server to run at start: 
```
sudo update-rc.d Easy-IOT defaults
```

## Benchmark

* 20000 batch insert (cURL post queries)
* Total Duration: 70 minutes
* AVG 4.76 insertion/min
* This is a very low cpu/ram server(Celeron M 900Mhz processor)
* 100% Http Status-code 200
* TBC: at the beginning, avg inertion was higher .. this is probably due to latencies in SQLite DB
